class AugurInterface:
    """
    Handles connection and queries to Augur database.

    Attributes:
    -----------
        pconfig : bool
            Flag of whether pconfig list was used to load current config.

        engine : _engine.Engine instance
            SQLAlchemy engine with credentials to connect to Augur database.

        user : str
            User credential to Augur database.

        password: str
            Password credential to Augur database.

        host : str
            Host credential to Augur database.

        port : str
            Port credential to Augur database.
            Which port on the server machine we'll target.

        database : str
            Database credential to Augur database.
            Which of the available databases on the server machine we'll target.

        schema : str
            Schema credential to Augur database.
            The target schema of the database we want to access.

        config_loaded : bool
            Flag of whether configuration params for database have been loaded.

    Methods:
    --------
        get_engine():
            Connects to Augur databse with supplied credentials and
            returns engine object.

        run_query(query_string):
            Runs a SQL-query against Augur database and returns resulting
            Pandas dataframe.

        package_pconfig():
            Packages current credentials into a list for transportation to workers.
            We need to do this because _engine.Engine objects can't be pickled and
            passed as parameters to workers via Queue objects.

        load_pconfig():
            Loads credentials for AugurInterface object from a pconfig.
            We need to do this because _engine.Engine objects can't be pickled and
            passed as parameters to workers via Queue objects.
