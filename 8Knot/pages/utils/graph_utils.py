    Utility needed in page visualizations-
    when the user inputs an 'interval', they're wanting to view
    data in some time window. This function converts that
    'interval' value to the necessary Plotly figure update values.

    Args:
    -----
        interval (str | int): How long between time bins, user selected.

    Returns:
    --------
        x_r ([str]): Time-bin strings.
        x_name (str): Name of bin-duration.
        hover (str): String-structure for graph to print on mouse-hover.
